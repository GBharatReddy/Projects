****Academic Projects: ML and Data Analytics Projects | Python and ML Toolkits****




**1. Cryptocurrency Price Prediction –** 
- Built ML models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, KNN) in Python to forecast Bitcoin prices, with Linear Regression achieving the best accuracy (RMSE: 1407.10) and Moving Averages emerging as key predictors.


**2. Mushroom Classification –** 
- Built ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Support Vector Machines) in Python to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous, achieving 100% accuracy with tree-based methods after feature engineering and EDA.
- Performed information gain and entropy calculations to identify the most important features (e.g., odor, cap color).
- Demonstrated the role of feature selection and entropy-based splitting in improving classification accuracy.


**3. User Behavior Analysis on Social Media –** 
- Applied clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) using Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib) to segment user engagement patterns, achieving a Silhouette Score of 0.58 and generating insights for personalization and retention.
