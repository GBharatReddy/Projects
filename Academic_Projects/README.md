****Academic Projects: ML and Data Analytics Projects | User Behavior, Cryptocurrency, Mushroom Classification | Python and ML Toolkits****

**Cryptocurrency Price Prediction –** Built ML models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, KNN) in Python to forecast Bitcoin prices, with Linear Regression achieving the best accuracy (RMSE: 1407.10) and Moving Averages emerging as key predictors.

**Mushroom Classification –** Built ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) in Python to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous, achieving 100% accuracy with tree-based methods after feature engineering and EDA.

**User Behavior Analysis on Social Media –** Applied clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) using Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib) to segment user engagement patterns, achieving a Silhouette Score of 0.58 and generating insights for personalization and retention.
